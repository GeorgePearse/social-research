# social-research
Fran's quest into data science for social research 

- pandas -> the main package for interacting with tabular datasets (like excel but for python) 
- numpy -> a package for analysis of arrays (grids of numbers) 
- sklearn -> a package for machine learning on tabular datasets 

**Week 1** -> Loading and saving datasets 

Project Plans 
* Deploy a streamlit app to streamlit cloud 
* Load an excel sheet to streamlit before starting to analyse it 
* Use jupyter-scatter and an LLM to analyse clusters and themes in text.
